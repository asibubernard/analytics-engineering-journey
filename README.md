My Analytics Engineering learning journey with dbt, BigQuery, and healthcare data

# Analytics Engineering Portfolio

Hi! I'm Bernard Asibu from Ghana.

## Background
- BSc in Health Information Management  
- Postgraduate Certificate in Management Information Systems (MIS)  
- 2 years as Health Information Officer (patient records, data privacy, health systems)  
- 4 years software development experience  

I want to combine my healthcare knowledge with strong data engineering skills to build reliable analytics pipelines.

## Goal
Get a **remote Analytics Engineer job** — preferably in health-tech, insurance, or any company that needs clean, tested data for decisions.

## My 16-Week Journey
I'm following a self-study path to master the modern data stack:  
SQL → dbt → Airbyte → Prefect → BigQuery → orchestration → production pipelines → healthcare-focused projects.

### Week 1: Analytics Engineering Mindset & Modern Data Stack Overview
**What I learned:**  
- Role of an analytics engineer  
- ELT vs ETL (why ELT is better today)  
- Modern data stack components  
- T-shaped skills, medallion layers (bronze/silver/gold), dbt viewpoint

## Let's Connect
Open to remote Analytics Engineer roles — especially in healthcare, insurance, Pharmacy, or data-driven companies.  
Happy to discuss projects, share code, or chat about opportunities!
